# Todo List v2

## Overview

This is a mini project for managing your to-do lists. You can access the main todo list on the [Home Page](https://jealous-red-school-uniform.cyclic.cloud). What makes this project special is its ability to create custom todo lists. You can create your own todo list by adding the todo list name to the end of the home URL.

For example, to access a custom todo list, use this URL format:

- Custom todo list: `https://jealous-red-school-uniform.cyclic.cloud/<custom-todo-list-name>`
